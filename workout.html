										<h2 id="content">Introduction:</h2>
										<p> Regular exercise and physical activity play a crucial role in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. 
											As part of a comprehensive fitness journey, individuals often monitor and track their workout 
											progress to assess their performance, set goals, and make informed adjustments to their routines.
											When I moved in 2018, I realized that my health wasn’t what I’d wanted it to be. Being a 
											little overweight, while also struggling to do the physical things I wanted to, I knew I 
											had to make a change. Being a data driven person, there’s a near infinite amount of workout 
											plans, coach advice, fitness standards, diets and more and I knew that with the help of data, 
											I can find what works for me. In this data analysis project, we delve into the workout and 
											weight data to see exercise patterns, performance trends, and overall progress.
										<h4>Research Question:</h4>
											The central research question driving this analysis is: How can we leverage the available workout 
											data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the individual's exercise habits, track their progress 
											over time, and identify areas for improvement? By exploring various aspects of the workout data, 
											including <i>exercise type</i>, <i>intensity</i>, <i>frequency</i>, and specific <i>exercises performed</i>, we strive 
											to extract meaningful insights that can enhance the individual's training regimen.
											<br></br>	
										<h4>Data Sources:</h4>
											The primary source of data for this analysis is my personal workout log. 
											The workout log records detailed information about each exercise session, 
											such as the date, exercise type, duration, intensity level in the form of RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion), 
											and more. This rich dataset serves as a valuable resource for examining my workout and measurement
											history and assessing my fitness journey comprehensively.
										<br></br>
										<h4>Why Google Sheets?</h4>
										<p>In the context of tracking and analyzing workout data, utilizing a spreadsheet-based system like <strong>Google Sheets</strong> offers 
											several advantages and makes it an ideal method for collecting and organizing such information. Here's an overview of why a 
											spreadsheet was my preferred choice for maintaining a workout log:</p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Data Organization:</strong> A spreadsheet provides a structured format with rows and columns, allowing for 
													systematic organization of workout and measurement data. Each workout event can be recorded as a row, with specific 
													attributes such as exercise type, RPE, rest times, and notes stored in respective columns. This structure enables 
													easy sorting, filtering, and analysis of data based on various parameters.</li>
												<p></p>
												<li><Strong>Ease of use:</Strong> In order to actually make use of the tracking system, it was important that the barrier to 
													using it be as small as possible. The thought of bringing a laptop to the gym, or going for a run with my desktop in a 
													book bag couldn’t be a possibility. Google sheets offered the best solution for me as, like many others, I’ve almost 
													always got my phone nearby and certainly do if I’m working out. The ease of use and portability of google sheets 
													was a big selling factor. What also made the decision easy was the ease and integration of google forms. </li>
												<p></p>
												<li><strong>Analysis and Visualization:</strong> Spreadsheets offer powerful data analysis and visualization capabilities, 
													enabling me to derive insights from my workout and measurement data. I can leverage built-in functions and formulas to 
													calculate summary statistics, identify trends, and generate charts or graphs for visual representation of progress. 
													These analysis tools facilitate a comprehensive understanding of workout patterns, performance improvements, and areas 
													for further development.
												</li>
											</ul>
											<h2 id="content">Setup: Sheets and Forms</h2>
											<div class="row">
											<h3 >Creating Forms</h3>
													<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/workout/Sheets_Form2.png" height='200'alt="Drop down tap for Forms" /></span> Google Sheets and Forms working 
														together offer a comprehensive solution for data collection, organization, analysis, and collaboration. The seamless 
														integration between these two tools enhances productivity, promotes real-time collaboration, and simplifies the 
														entire data management process. Whether it's conducting surveys, gathering feedback, or analyzing data, the combination 
														of Google Sheets and Forms provides a versatile platform for effective data-driven decision-making. Creating and pairing a 
													    Form is as easy as clicking from a dropdown menu. Once a form is created and connected to a sheet, all submitted responses
													will be automatically populated in the sheet with an associated timestamp. </p>

														<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/workout/Data.png" alt="Weight Data" /></span></div>
											<h3>Ease of use</h3>
													<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Workout/Form_Phone.png" height="250" alt="Phone Screen" /></span> Like most people, I often 
														find myself without immediate access to my computer, but I almost always have my phone within reach. One of the primary factors that 
														led me to choose Google Sheets and Forms for tracking and analyzing my workout data is their exceptional mobile usability. By setting 
														up a direct link to my custom form as an icon on my phone's home screen, I significantly streamlined the process of inputting data, 
														disregarding the added advantage of having my personalized tracking icons readily visible throughout the day. This convenient 
														setup not only acted as a tremendous source of motivation but also served as a constant reminder to prioritize and maintain my fitness routine.

											<h2> So What Do We Do With This Data?</h2>
												<p> This analysis could go in a hundred different directions. From tracking the program over time, to strength gains, to specifics like how difficult do I rate an exercise that I did consistently over time. Ultimately there are two things I’d like to highlight here for demonstrating purposes, but know that the data goes a lot deeper. 
												</p>
												<ol>
												<li>	<strong>Weight</strong>. Being overweight at the time, tracking weight was a reasonable proxy that everything was working as intended. Weight loss or gain can be an indicator of the effectiveness of the program, dietary changes, or overall lifestyle modifications. If the weight weren’t coming down then it’d be time to dive in further and analyze the “why’s” or “why not’s” of my weight loss journey. Weight is a straightforward metric to measure and It provides a tangible and quantifiable measurement of progress.
												</li>	
												<p></p>
												<li>	<strong>Pull ups</strong>. To go back to 2018 when I moved and decided to make some changes. Before I’d moved, I remember a time when I was hanging out with some friends and we were testing our physical capabilities. Push ups, sit-ups, etc. When it was my time to test out my pull ups, I grabbed the bar and couldn’t manage to lift myself even a few centimeters from my hanging position. I was mortified. As I started my fitness journey, pull-ups became the status symbol of great strength. People who could throw themselves up to the bar with ease, in my mind, had demonstrated such a mastery of their strength and body that the ability to replicate that became my goal.
